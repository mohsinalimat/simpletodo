- To **edit** a todo that you crated, use the **pen shaped button** on the **bottom right of the todo card** and **fill the form.**
- To **delete** a todo, use the **trash shaped button** on the **bottom right** **of the todo card**.
- To **mark a todo as done**, use the **tick shaped button** on the **bottom right of the todo card**.
