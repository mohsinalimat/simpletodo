# Simple TODO README

# What is Simple TODO ?

Just an app that I made to learn electronJS

# How to install ?

Go to [releases](https://github.com/yussufjpg/simpletodo/packages) and download the latest release, it will start downloading the app.

# How to use ?

So simple, use the top right **plus shaped button** and **fill the form** to create a todo.
To **edit** a todo that you crated, use the **pen shaped button** on the **bottom right** **of the** **todo card** and **fill the form.**
To **delete** a todo, use the **trash shaped button** on the **bottom right** **of the todo card**.
To **search** todos, use the **search shaped button** on the **top left of the navbar**, it will open a search bar.
